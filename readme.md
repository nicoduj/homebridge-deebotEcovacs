Plugin for controlling your [deebot Ecovacs](https://www.ecovacs.com/global/deebot-robotic-vacuum-cleaner) from [Ecovacs](https://www.ecovacs.com/global/support/) through [HomeBridge](https://github.com/nfarina/homebridge) .

Each Deebot is shown through

- One fan. Fan speed will determine the deebot speed. Direction will handle auto / edge mode. Switching off will make the deebot stop, switching on will make it start cleaning,
- One Switch that will allow you to start lceaning (auto / edge mode depending on Fan direction), and go back to charge when switched off,
- One Switch that will play a sound on your Deebot,
- One Motion sensor that will be triggered in case your deebot needs attention.

The battery percentage / charging status is shown in the detail pane of each service.

`npm install -g homebridge-deebotecovacs`

**IMPORTANT**
_This might not be needed anymore since 1.2.0_

If you encounter any issue while installing, you might have to install additionnal packages on your environment since the main dependency of it depends on canvas library which is not available for all configurations. See there for more details : [canvas compiling](https://github.com/Automattic/node-canvas#compiling).

For use in the [oznu/homebridge](https://github.com/oznu/docker-homebridge) Docker image (Alpine Linux) please add the following line to your `startup.sh` script and restart the container. You can edit this file in directly in the Homebride UI by selecting the drop down menu in the upper-right-corner and selecting _Startup Script_.

```
apk add build-base cairo-dev jpeg-dev pango-dev giflib-dev librsvg-dev
```

You can also use the [PACKAGES](https://github.com/oznu/docker-homebridge#optional-settings) env variable directly with docker

```bash
-e PACKAGES=build-base,cairo-dev,jpeg-dev,pango-dev,giflib-dev,librsvg-dev
```
